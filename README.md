A deep learning-based method called Compression-based Genomic Prediction using Convolutional Neural Network (ConvCGP), which utilizes compressed information generated by autoencoders to predict the genotypic values of a target trait. The key contributions of this work are as follows: First, we demonstrate how high-dimensional genome-wide polymorphism data can be effectively compressed using autoencoders. Second, we show how the compressed data can be applied to predict genotypic values using CNN. To assess the performance of ConvCGP, we employed two rice genome datasets: C7AIR, with 7,098 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and HDRA, with 700,000 SNPs.
